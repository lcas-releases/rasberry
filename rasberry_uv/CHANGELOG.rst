  1. sim_riseholme-uv.yaml tmule config is removed and riseholme-uv.yaml can be used for both the physical robot as well as simulation
  2. config file (rasberry_uv/config/riseholme.yaml) for configuring which rows have to be treated and start and end nodes of the rows

  4. rasberry_uv/src/uv_treatment.py no longer takes `use_sim` as an argument
  5. rasberry_uv/CMakeLists.txt install targets updated
  6. rasberry_bringup/robot_bringup.launch takes an new argument with_gui to enable/disable gazebo gui. tmule configs using this launch file have been updated.
